Currently, I hold the position of Research Associate 2 at the [I3D lab](https://cambum.net/I3D.htm) within the Department of Design and Manufacturing(DnM) of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, guided by [Pradipta Biswas](https://cambum.net/PB/). Prior to this role, I completed my undergraduate studies at RIT, Kottayam, specializing in Electronics and Communication Engineering. During my time at RIT, I was as an Undergraduate Researcher at the Centre for Advanced Signal Processing ([CASP lab](http://www.rit.ac.in/ece/CASP/)) under mentorship of [Manju Manuel](http://www.rit.ac.in/fprofiledisplay.php?penno=603400&dep=ECE).

Research interests
======
My interest lies in the intersection of Robotics, control and perception. Specifically in three fields
1) Providing probabilistic safety assurances for autonomous systems in cluttered environments leveraging robust algorithms.
2) Computer vision-based autonomous systems for real-world applications with a particular emphasis on controller evaluation and selection.
3) Developing assistive robotic systems for enhanced autonomy.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
