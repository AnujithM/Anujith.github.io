<span style="font-size: 14px;">Currently, I hold the position of Research Associate 2 at the [I3D lab](https://cambum.net/I3D.htm) within the Department of Design and Manufacturing(DnM) of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, guided by [Pradipta Biswas](https://cambum.net/PB/). Prior to this role, I completed my undergraduate studies at RIT, Kottayam, specializing in Electronics and Communication Engineering. During my time at RIT, I was as an Undergraduate Researcher at the Centre for Advanced Signal Processing ([CASP lab](http://www.rit.ac.in/ece/CASP/)) under mentorship of [Manju Manuel](http://www.rit.ac.in/fprofiledisplay.php?penno=603400&dep=ECE)</span>.

Research interests
======
<span style="font-size: 14px;">My interest lies in the intersection of Robotics, control and perception. Specifically in three fields
1) Providing probabilistic safety assurances for autonomous systems in cluttered environments leveraging robust algorithms.
2) Computer vision-based autonomous systems for real-world applications with a particular emphasis on controller evaluation and selection.
3) Developing assistive robotic systems for enhanced autonomy</span>.

<!-- **Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository. -->
